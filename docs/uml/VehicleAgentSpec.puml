NOTES:
A driver is a BeamAgent and does NOT need to be physically inside vehicle
passengers are BeamVehicles and are physically in vehicle and move with the vehicle
(e.g. a PersonAgent who is driving alone would be the driver of the vehicle and his/her
HumanBodyVehicle would be a passenger)
HumanBody is a special case, it has no passengers, just a driver
